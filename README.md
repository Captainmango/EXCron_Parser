# CronParser

## Description

This is a small CLI project created to learn Elixir. This will offer simple functionality in parsing cron expressions and will eventually be something I'd like to plug into a cron scheduler on a server to manage data tasks or other background work that needs to take place. It also allows for the creation of files to be scheduled for work.

## Installation

Clone the git repo to your machine and run mix deps.get to install the dependencies for the project

```bash

$ git clone git@github.com:Captainmango/EXCron_Parser.git

$ mix deps.get

```

Once done, the project can be started by changing into the project root and running mix escript.build to build, then ./cron_parser to run the app.
